            I am an aspiring web developer with knowledge in C#, Java, OOP, Git & GitBash, HTML & CSS, and am currently learning JavaScript. 
            Once I finish my Boot Camp in February, I will be able to develop fullstack web applications. 
            Currently I have completed a project focused on OOP principles in C#, and will be doing more projects soon.
            The project is focused on creating a point of sale terminal for shopping, more info and a link can be found on my portfolio page.
            Along with the project, I have completed many labs across the various languages I've learned, many of which can be found on my GitHub.

            I live in Sterling Heights, a city just outside Detroit. 
            I enjoy living in Michigan for its seasons, however, I'm not a big fan of snow in the winter. 
            Overall, the natural beauty and variety of activities available make Michigan a nice place to live.
            Being located next to such a big city, Sterling Heights and the surrounding area have an abundance of unique stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues.
